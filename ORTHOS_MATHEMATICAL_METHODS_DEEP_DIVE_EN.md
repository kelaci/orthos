## 1. HEBBIAN LEARNING - The Foundation

### 🧠 Core Concept

> *"Neurons that fire together, wire together"* — Donald Hebb (1949)

This is the oldest and most natural learning rule, inspired by biological brain function.

### 📐 Mathematical Formulation

#### Classical Hebbian Rule

```
Δw_ij = η · x_i · y_j
```

**Explanation:**
- `Δw_ij` = Weight change (how much the connection strength changes)
- `η` (eta) = Learning rate (0-1, typically 0.01)
- `x_i` = Pre-synaptic activity (input signal)
- `y_j` = Post-synaptic activity (output signal)

**Everyday analogy:** If two friends frequently meet and talk together, their friendship strengthens. If they rarely see each other, the connection weakens.

### 🔧 ORTHOS Implementation

```python
# Classical Hebbian update
def hebbian_update(weights, pre_activity, post_activity, learning_rate=0.01):
    """
    Δw = η · pre · post
    
    Every connection updates by activity multiplication
    """
    weight_update = learning_rate * np.outer(post_activity, pre_activity)
    return weights + weight_update
```

**How it works in practice:**
1. Inputs activate the neuron
2. The neuron's activity affects incoming connections
3. Frequent activation → strengthening connections
4. Rare activation → weakening connections

### 📊 Oja's Rule - Stabilized Version

```
Δw = η · post · (pre - post · w)
```

**Why important?** The classical Hebbian rule has a problem: weights can grow indefinitely. Oja's rule prevents this through "normalization."

**Analogy:** It's like continuously updating a phone book while ensuring no one gets infinite priority.

### 🧪 BCM Rule - Sliding Threshold

```
Δw = η · post · (post - θ) · pre
```

Where `θ` (theta) is an adaptive threshold that adjusts to average activity.

**Practical significance:**
- Low activity (< θ) → connections weaken (long-term depression, LTD)
- High activity (> θ) → connections strengthen (long-term potentiation, LTP)

**Real-life example:** Learning processes where attention and repetition play decisive roles.

## 2. PLASTICITY CONTROL - Adaptive Learning

### 🎯 What is Plasticity?

Plasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt. In ORTHOS, this dynamically adjusts learning parameters.

### 📐 Dual-Timescale System

ORTHOS's innovation: maintaining two distinct "traces," just like the biological brain.

#### Fast Trace

```
T_fast(t+1) = τ_fast · T_fast(t) + η_fast · H(x, y)
```

**Parameters:**
- `τ_fast = 0.95` (tau) = Fast decay coefficient
- `η_fast = 0.05` = Fast learning rate

**Analogy:** Short-term memory, like taking notes during a workday. Quick to write down, but much is forgotten by evening.

#### Slow Trace

```
T_slow(t+1) = τ_slow · T_slow(t) + η_slow · T_fast(t)
```

**Parameters:**
- `τ_slow = 0.99` = Slow decay coefficient
- `η_slow = 0.01` = Slow learning rate

**Analogy:** Long-term memory, like learning fundamental skills (cycling, swimming). Builds slowly but persists for years.

```

### 🏠 Homeostatic Regulation

**Problem:** Hebbian learning is unstable - weights can grow indefinitely.

**Solution - Two Mechanisms:**

#### 1. Trace Normalization

```python
fast_norm = np.linalg.norm(fast_trace)
if fast_norm > homeostatic_target:  # e.g., 5.0
    fast_trace *= homeostatic_target / (fast_norm + 1e-6)
```

**Explanation:** If traces grow too large, we proportionally reduce them.

**Analogy:** Like a thermostat that cools the system during excessive heating.

#### 2. Weight Decay

```python
weights *= (1.0 - decay_rate)  # decay_rate = 0.001
```

**Explanation:** Every step minimally weakens the weights.

**Analogy:** Like pruning in gardening - continuously removing excess branches.

## 3. HIERARCHICAL PROCESSING - Multi-Level Abstraction

### 🏗️ System Architecture

ORTHOS processes information at different temporal scales, just like the human brain.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 📐 Mathematical Model

#### Temporal Compression

Each level has a `temporal_resolution` parameter:

```python
if t % temporal_resolution == 0:
    # Only update when it's this level's turn
    output = process_layer(input_data)
```

**Example:**
- Level 0: t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (every step)
- Level 1: t = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (every 2nd step)
- Level 2: t = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, ... (every 4th step)

**Analogy:** Like a corporate structure where:
- Workers track every minute
- Middle managers report every hour
- Top executives decide daily

### 🔄 Bidirectional Communication

#### Bottom-Up

```
Raw Data → Features → Sequences → Concepts
```

**Example:** Image processing
1. Raw pixels (pixel values)
2. Edges and shapes (features)
3. Objects (sequences)
4. Meanings and categories (concepts)

#### Top-Down

```
Context → Expectations → Attention → Goals
```

**Example:** Reading
1. We know we're reading a story (context)
2. We expect sentences (expectations)
3. We attend to keywords (attention)
4. We want to understand character motivations (goals)

### 💾 State Management

Each level maintains its own internal state:

```python
class HierarchicalLevel:
    def __init__(self, level_id, temporal_resolution):
        self.level_id = level_id
        self.temporal_resolution = temporal_resolution
        self.current_representation = None
        self.parent_level = None
        self.child_levels = []
```

**Practical application:** A video processing system where:
- Low level: detects frame-to-frame changes
- Mid level: identifies motion patterns
- High level: interprets events and stories

---

## 4. CONSENSUS ENGINE - Multi-Source Aggregation

### 🎯 What is Consensus?

The consensus engine consolidates estimates from different hierarchy levels into a single robust output.

### 📐 Mathematical Aggregation

#### 1. Outlier Detection

```python
# Median-based center
median_pred = np.median(predictions, axis=0)

# Euclidean distance from median
dists = np.linalg.norm(predictions - median_pred, axis=1)

# Robust standard deviation estimation (MAD)
mad = np.median(np.abs(dists - np.median(dists)))
std_est = 1.4826 * mad

# Z-scores
z_scores = dists / std_est

# Mask outliers
outlier_mask = z_scores > outlier_threshold
```

**Analogy:** Like filtering extreme responses in an opinion poll to get the "majority view."

#### 2. Weighted Voting (v5.0 Uncertainty-Weighted)

In v5.0, ORTHOS transitioned from simple confidence weighting to **Uncertainty-Weighted Voting (Inverse Variance Weighting)**. This is mathematically optimal for Bayesian systems.

```python
# Weights based on uncertainty (inverse variance)
# Lower uncertainty = higher weight = more trusted prediction
weights = 1.0 / (valid_uncertainties + 1e-6)
weights /= np.sum(weights)  # Normalize

# Final estimate
final_pred = np.average(valid_predictions, axis=0, weights=weights)
```

**Why this is better?**
In a Bayesian context, the "correctness" of a source is best represented by its variance (uncertainty). Weighting by $1/\sigma^2$ ensures that the fusion result is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for Gaussian distributions.

**Example:**
- Level 0 (low-level, noisy): Prediction=10.5, Uncertainty=2.0
- Level 3 (high-level, stable): Prediction=11.2, Uncertainty=0.1
Result will be very close to 11.2 because Level 3 is much more "certain" of its result.

#### 3. Agreement Score

```python
agreement_score = len(valid_predictions) / len(total_predictions)
```

**Significance:** 0.0 = no one agrees, 1.0 = everyone agrees

### 🔧 Consensus Configuration (v5.0 Updated)

```python
@dataclass
class LevelPrediction:
    level: int              # Level identifier
    prediction: np.ndarray  # Estimate (can be 0-D, 1-D, or 2-D)
    confidence: float       # Confidence (0-1)
    uncertainty: float      # Uncertainty

@dataclass
class ConsensusResult:
    prediction: np.ndarray         # Final estimate (Note: replaced aggregated_prediction in v5.0)
    agreement_score: float         # Agreement degree
    uncertainty: float             # Aggregated uncertainty
    outlier_count: int             # Number of outliers
    participating_levels: List[int]  # Participating levels
```

### ✨ v5.0 Feature: Auto-Projection

A key innovation in v5.0 is the automatic handling of mismatched dimensions between levels.

**1. Dimension Validation**
The system automatically detects if all levels output the same dimension. If not, it either raises an error (if `auto_projection=False`) or invokes the projection mechanism.

**2. Projection Logic**
- **Upsampling**: Uses `np.tile()` for repetition and handles remainders via concatenation.
- **Downsampling**: Uses slicing with a calculated step size: `prediction[::step][:target_dim]`.

**Analogy:** Like translating between different languages (resolutions) automatically so everyone can participate in the meeting.

**Practical example:** Autopilot system where:
- Lidar: "Depression 10 meters ahead"
- Radar: "Object 8 meters ahead"
- Camera: "Vehicle 9 meters ahead"
- Consensus: "Obstacle ~9 meters ahead, confidence high (0.9)"

## 5. FILTERS - Probabilistic State Estimation

### 🎯 Why Need Filters?

ORTHOS's filters track system state from noisy measurements, like a pilot tracking aircraft position from instruments.

### 📐 Kalman Filter (KF) - Linear Systems

#### Basic Concepts

The Kalman Filter performs optimal recursive Bayesian estimation for linear Gaussian systems.

#### Mathematical Equations

**1. State Prediction:**
```
x' = F · x + B · u      (State prediction)
P' = F · P · F^T + Q    (Covariance prediction)
```

- `x` = State vector (what we track)
- `P` = State covariance (our uncertainty)
- `F` = State transition matrix (how state changes)
- `B` = Control matrix (what we affect)
- `u` = Control input (what we do)
- `Q` = Process noise covariance

**2. Measurement Update:**
```
y = z - H · x'           (Innovation)
S = H · P' · H^T + R    (Innovation covariance)
K = P' · H^T · S^(-1)   (Kalman Gain)
x = x' + K · y          (State update)

# Covariance Update - Choose Form:
P = (I - K · H) · P'               (Standard form - faster)
P = (I-KH)P'(I-KH)^T + K R K^T     (v5.0 Joseph form - stable ✨)
```

- `z` = Measurement (what we see)
- `H` = Observation matrix (how we see the state)
- `R` = Measurement noise covariance
- `K` = Kalman Gain (how much we trust the measurement)
- `y` = Innovation (how much measurement differs from prediction)
- `S` = Innovation covariance

### ✨ v5.0 Advanced Kalman Filter Architectures

ORTHOS v5.0 introduces two critical filter variants for stability and efficiency in complex environments.

#### 1. Square Root Kalman Filter (SR-KF) ✨
Numerical stability is critical when running filters for thousands of steps. Standard KF can suffer from precision loss, leading to non-positive-definite covariance matrices (filter "crashes").

**The Core Idea:** Instead of tracking $P$, we track its Cholesky factor $S$ such that $P = SS^T$.
- **Precision:** Working with $S$ effectively doubles the numerical precision.
- **Stability:** $P$ is guaranteed to remain positive semi-definite.

**Prediction (QR-based):**
$$ [F S_{k-1} \quad Q^{1/2}]^T \xrightarrow{QR} [R^T \quad 0]^T \implies S_{k|k-1} = R^T $$

**Advantages:** Essential for long-running autonomous systems where numerical drift can lead to catastrophic failure.

#### 2. Block-Diagonal Kalman Filter ✨
Balancing the speed of Diagonal KF and the accuracy of Full KF.

**The Core Idea:** Group related variables into fully-correlated "blocks," but assume independence between blocks.
- **Example:** $[position, velocity]$ are in one block, $[temperature, humidity]$ in another.
- **Complexity:** $O(N \cdot B^2)$ where $B$ is block size (vs $O(N^3)$ for full or $O(N)$ for diagonal).

**Benefits:** Maintains critical cross-correlations (like position/velocity) while discarding irrelevant ones (like position/light-level), saving ~80% of computation on high-dimensional neural states.

### ✨ v5.0 Kalman Filter Enhancements

#### 2. Diagonal Covariance Optimization (v5.0 O(N) Speedup) ✨

For high-dimensional states (n > 64), ORTHOS v5.0 automatically switches to a truly diagonal update path.

*   **Standard**: $O(n^3)$ complexity, $O(n^2)$ memory.
*   **Diagonal**: $O(n)$ complexity, $O(n)$ memory.

**Mathematical formulation for diagonal update:**
$$K = P / (P + R)$$
$$x = x + K(z - x)$$
$$P = (1 - K)P$$

**Improvement:** For 256-dimensional states, this provides a **74x speedup**, making real-time processing of large neural vectors possible.

#### 3. Bayesian Fusion for Dual Updates (v5.0) ✨

Previously, levels performed two separate filter updates for bottom-up and top-down data. v5.0 uses **Bayesian Fusion** via the **Parallel Combination Rule**.

```python
# Bayesian fusion: weighted average by inverse variance
# r_bu: bottom-up uncertainty, r_td: top-down uncertainty
inv_r_bu = 1.0 / r_bu
inv_r_td = 1.0 / r_td
inv_sum = inv_r_bu + inv_r_td

# Fused estimate matches the point of maximum probability between sources
fused_est = (bu_est * inv_r_bu + td_est * inv_r_td) / inv_sum
fused_unc = 1.0 / inv_sum
```

**Advantage:** This is 2x faster than double-updating and mathematically ensures that the fused uncertainty is always lower than either individual source, effectively "shrinking" the error bar.

#### 4. Adaptive Noise Floor (Innovation Adaptation)

In v5.0, the `_adapt_noise` logic ensures the system remains responsive even in stable environments.
- **Large Innovation**: Increase R (trust measurements less).
- **Small Innovation**: Decrease R (trust measurements more).
- **CRITICAL**: A floor value (`min_obs_noise`) is enforced to prevent filter "lock-up."

**Analogy:** Tracking a car where:
- State: position, velocity, acceleration
- Measurement: GPS position, speedometer
- Transition: physics motion curve
- Noise: GPS error, instrument error

#### Practical Example

```python
# 2D car tracking
kf = KalmanFilter(
    state_dim=4,      # [x, y, vx, vy]  (position and velocity)
    obs_dim=2,        # [x, y]          (only see position)
    process_noise=0.01,
    obs_noise=0.1
)

# State transition: constant velocity
F = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1, 0],  # x_new = x_old + vx
    [0, 1, 0, 1],  # y_new = y_old + vy
    [0, 0, 1, 0],  # vx_new = vx_old
    [0, 0, 0, 1]   # vy_new = vy_old
])

# Observation: only see position
H = np.array([
    [1, 0, 0, 0],  # see x
    [0, 1, 0, 0]   # see y
])

# Cycle
for measurement in measurements:
    # 1. Prediction
    kf.predict(F=F)
    
    # 2. Measurement-based update
    kf.update(measurement, H=H)
    
    # 3. Estimated state
    estimated_state = kf.x
    estimated_velocity = kf.x[2:4]
```

### 🔄 Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) - Non-Linear Systems

#### Why Need EKF?

When the system is non-linear, the Kalman Filter doesn't work directly. We use Jacobian matrices for linearization.

#### Mathematical Extension

**1. Non-linear dynamics:**
```
x' = f(x, u)        (Non-linear state transition)
P' = F · P · F^T + Q
```

**2. Non-linear observation:**
```
y = z - h(x')       (Non-linear observation)
S = H · P' · H^T + R
K = P' · H^T · S^(-1)
x = x' + K · y
P = (I - K · H) · P'
```

- `f(x, u)` = Non-linear dynamics function
- `h(x)` = Non-linear observation function
- `F` = Jacobian of f(x) (dynamics derivative)
- `H` = Jacobian of h(x) (observation derivative)

**Analogy:** A robot arm where:
- Non-linear dynamics: non-linear relationship between angle and velocity
- Non-linear observation: camera image → angle

#### Practical Example

```python
# Robot arm tracking
ekf = ExtendedKalmanFilter(
    state_dim=2,      # [θ, ω]  (angle and angular velocity)
    obs_dim=1,        # [x]     (x position on camera image)
    dynamics_fn=lambda x, u: x + u,      # simple motion
    observation_fn=lambda x: np.sin(x[0])  # angle → pixel (non-linear)

### 🎱 Particle Filter - General Systems

#### Why Need Particle Filter?

Kalman filters only work for Gaussian systems. The particle filter can handle arbitrary distributions using "particles" (samples).

#### Mathematical Foundations

**Set of Particles:**
```
{ (x^(1), w^(1)), (x^(2), w^(2)), ..., (x^(N), w^(N)) }
```

- `x^(i)` = i-th particle (state sample)
- `w^(i)` = i-th particle weight (probability)
- `N` = Number of particles (typically 100-1000)

**1. Prediction:**
```
x^(i) ∼ p(x^(i) | x^(i)_old, u)
```
Propagate each particle through dynamics with noise.

**2. Measurement Update:**
```
w^(i) = p(z | x^(i))
```
Update weights by probability of seeing this particle.

**3. Resampling:**
```
If 1 / Σ(w^(i)^2) < N/2:
    Resample with high-weight particles
```

**Analogy:** Like a lottery where winners get more tickets.

#### Practical Example

```python
# Car tracking with non-linear dynamics
pf = ParticleFilter(
    n_particles=100,
    state_dim=4,      # [x, y, vx, vy]
    dynamics_fn=lambda x, u, noise: x + u + noise,  # motion + noise
    observation_fn=lambda x, z: np.exp(-0.5 * ((x[:2] - z)**2).sum())  # Gaussian likelihood
)

# Cycle
for measurement in measurements:
    # 1. Prediction (propagate all particles)
    pf.predict(process_noise_std=0.1)
    
    # 2. Measurement update (update weights)
    pf.update(measurement)
    
    # 3. Average state
    estimated_state = pf.get_mean()
    
    # 4. Uncertainty
    uncertainty = pf.get_uncertainty()
```

### 📊 Filter Comparison

| Filter | System | Advantages | Disadvantages | Applications |
|--------|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Kalman (KF)** | Linear, Gaussian | Optimal, fast | Only linear | GPS tracking, spacecraft |
| **EKF** | Non-linear, Gaussian | Supports non-linearity | Needs Jacobian | Robotics, autopilot |
| **Particle** | Any | General, multi-modal | Slow, needs many particles | Target tracking, SLAM |

## 6. HYBRID META-LEARNING - Learning to Learn

### 🎯 What is Meta-Learning?

Meta-learning is "learning to learn" — optimizing the learning process itself. ORTHOS v5.1 introduces a **Hybrid Meta-Learning (HML)** strategy that combines global evolutionary search with real-time local adaptation.

### 🧬 Component 1: Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) - Global Scale

Instead of simple elite selection, ORTHOS uses **Natural Evolution Strategies (NES)** for mapping the global landscape of optimal meta-parameters.

#### Mathematical Formulation

NES estimates the gradient of the expected fitness:
$$\nabla_{\theta} J \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma} \sum_{i=1}^{N} F_i \epsilon_i$$

**Where:**
- $F_i$ = Rank-normalized fitness score
- $\epsilon_i$ = Perturbation vector (noise)
- $\sigma$ = Mutation strength

**Key Features:**
1. **Rank Normalization**: Fitness scores are mapped to $[-0.5, 0.5]$, making the optimizer robust to outliers and non-linear reward scales.
2. **Natural Gradient**: Updates parameters in the direction of steepest increase in expected fitness, respecting the geometry of the parameter space.

### 🎰 Component 2: Contextual Bandit Meta-Controller - Online Scale

While NES handles global stability, the **Contextual Bandit** handles real-time agility. It modulates meta-parameters sub-second based on the current system "context."

#### State Representation (System Context)
The bandit observes the current environment:
- **Prediction Error**: Recent reconstruction loss trend.
- **Uncertainty**: Aggregated Bayesian uncertainty from the Probabilistic Spine.
- **Sparsity**: Current activity density in SAS layers.
- **Drift**: Rate of change in neural representations.

#### Optimization Goal
The controller maximizes a multi-objective reward:
$$R_t = -(\text{Error} + \lambda \cdot \text{Uncertainty} + \gamma \cdot \text{Instability})$$

**Modulation Example:**
- **In a "Storm" (High noise/error)**: Increase Observation Noise Scale ($R$) and decrease learning rate ($\eta$) to maintain stability.
- **In "Stationary" (Low noise)**: Decrease $R$ and increase $\eta$ to sharpen feature detection.

### 🏗️ Hybrid Architecture: Manager & Hooks

The **HybridMetaManager** orchestrates these scales:
1. **NES** updates the *Base Parameters* (the system's long-term DNA).
2. **Bandit** modulates these into *Active Parameters* (the system's immediate reaction).
3. **Safety Clamps** ensure neither scale ever pushes the system into unstable regimes.

#### Practical Example: Drone Saviour Recovery

When a drone loses GPS (High Uncertainty + High Drift):
1. **Context Detects**: `uncertainty=0.9`, `drift=0.8`.
2. **Meta-Bandit Action**: "Dampen sensors, boost internal prediction model."
3. **System Result**: KF relies more on internal motion models than noisy sensor data, preventing a crash until lock is regained.

#### Basic Algorithm

**1. Population Generation:**
```python
population = []
for i in range(population_size):  # e.g., 50 individuals
    perturbation = np.random.randn(dim) * sigma  # noise
    perturbed_params = mean_params + perturbation
    population.append(perturbed_params)
```

**Analogy:** Like selective breeding where we try different variations.

**2. Fitness Evaluation:**
```python
fitness_scores = []
for params in population:
    # Apply parameters
    apply_params(params)
    
    # Evaluate performance
    fitness = evaluate_performance()
    fitness_scores.append(fitness)
```

**Analogy:** Testing each variation in the task to see which works best.

**3. Elite Selection:**
```python
num_elites = int(population_size * elite_fraction)  # e.g., top 20%
elite_indices = np.argsort(fitness_scores)[-num_elites:]
elites = [population[i] for i in elite_indices]
```

**Analogy:** Selecting the best-performing individuals.

**4. Mean Update:**
```python
mean_params = mean_params + learning_rate * np.mean(elites - mean_params, axis=0)
```

**Analogy:** Next generation moves toward best individuals.

#### Practical Example

```python
# Plasticity parameter optimization
es = EvolutionaryStrategy(
    population_size=50,
    sigma=0.1,           # mutation strength
    learning_rate=0.01,  # learning rate
    elite_fraction=0.2   # top 20%
)

current_params = np.array([0.01, 0.95, 0.05])  # [lr, tau_fast, eta_fast]

for episode in range(100):
    # 1. Generate population
    population = es.generate_population(current_params)
    
    # 2. Evaluate each individual
    fitness_scores = []
    for params in population:
        # Apply parameters
        agent.set_plasticity_params(params)
        
        # Evaluate performance
        fitness = run_episode(agent, task)
        fitness_scores.append(fitness)
    
    # 3. Update parameters
    es.update_mean(current_params, population, fitness_scores)
    current_params = es.get_mean()
    
    print(f"Episode {episode}: Best fitness = {max(fitness_scores):.4f}")
```

### 📊 Metrics

#### Adaptation Speed
```python
convergence_rate = (final_performance - initial_performance) / num_episodes
```

**Analogy:** How fast does the system achieve performance.

#### Stability
```python
stability = np.std(performance_history[-10:])
```

**Analogy:** How much does performance fluctuate.

#### Plasticity Efficiency
```python
efficiency = performance_improvement / total_weight_change
```

**Analogy:** How much performance improvement per weight change.

## 8. SPARSE ATTENTION & STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY (SAS) - The Active Economy

### 🎯 Architectural Philosophy

Traditional neural networks are **Passive/Dense**: they process every input using every weight. ORTHOS v5.0 introduces the **SAS (Sparse Attention & Structural Plasticity)** framework, transitioning to an **Active/Sparse** model.

**Biological Inspiration:** The human brain has 100 trillion synapses, but only ~1% are active at any moment. SAS mimics this through activation and structural sparsity.

| Principle | Dense (v4.x) | Sparse (v5.0) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connectivity** | All-to-all | Selective (target: 10-30%) |
| **Processing** | Passive (all inputs) | Active (query relevant inputs) |
| **Topology** | Fixed after init | Dynamic (rewiring) |
| **Complexity** | $O(N^2)$ | $O(N \log N)$ or $O(N)$ |

### 📐 1. Masked Linear Topology

The foundation of SAS is the `MaskedLinear` layer, which enforces a binary mask $M$ on weights $W$.

```python
# Forward Pass
output = (weights * mask) @ input
```

**Significance:** Even if a weight is non-zero, if the mask is 0, no signal passes. This creates a "learned topology" of the network.

### 📐 2. Sparse Hebbian Attention (k-WTA)

Standard attention computes scores for all elements. Sparse Hebbian Attention uses **k-Winners-Take-All (k-WTA)** to select only the most relevant $k$ items.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
$$A_{sparse} = \text{k-WTA}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \odot M_{structural}\right) V$$

Where $k$ is typically $10-20\%$ of the sequence length. Only the "winners" get to participate in the softmax, drastically reducing noise and computational cost.

### 📐 3. Structural Plasticity (Rewiring)

Just like the brain forms new connections and prunes old ones, SAS performs **Synaptic Turnover**.

**The Rewiring Cycle:**
1.  **Pruning**: Remove connections that are weak (small weights) and old (maturity age).
2.  **Regrowth**: Randomly add new connections in areas with low density.
3.  **Consolidation**: Protect "important" synapses from being pruned based on their age and contribution to performance.

**Analogy:** Like a city transit system that periodically removes unused bus stops and adds new ones based on changing passenger patterns.

## 9. PARAMETER SENSITIVITY - What's Important?

### 📊 Key Parameters

#### Plasticity Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Effect | Sensitivity |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `fast_trace_decay` | 0.9-0.99 | Memory duration | High |
| `fast_trace_lr` | 0.01-0.1 | Adaptation speed | Medium |
| `slow_trace_decay` | 0.98-0.999 | Consolidation speed | High |
| `slow_trace_lr` | 0.001-0.05 | Long-term learning | Medium |
| `homeostatic_target` | 1.0-10.0 | Stability vs capacity | High |

#### Evolutionary Strategy Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Effect | Sensitivity |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `population_size` | 10-100 | Search robustness | Medium |
| `sigma` | 0.01-0.5 | Search extent | High |
| `learning_rate` | 0.001-0.1 | Convergence speed | Medium |
| `elite_fraction` | 0.1-0.5 | Selection strictness | Medium |

#### Kalman Filter Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Effect | Sensitivity |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `process_noise` | 0.001-0.1 | Model trust | High |
| `obs_noise` | 0.01-1.0 | Measurement trust | High |
| `use_joseph_form` (v5.0) | True/False | Numerical stability | High (long runs) |
| `use_diagonal_covariance` (v5.0) | True/False | Performance | High (high-dim) |

### 🎛️ Tuning Strategy

#### 1. Conservative Start

```python
# Low learning rates, high stability
cfg = OrthosConfig(
    fast_trace_lr=0.01,      # low
    slow_trace_lr=0.001,     # very low
    homeostatic_target=2.0,  # strict
    sigma=0.05,              # small mutation
    use_joseph_form=True,    # v5.0: numerical stability
    auto_projection=True     # v5.0: automatic dimension handling
)
```

**When:** Initial testing, stable operation needed.

#### 2. Progressive Tuning

```python
# Gradually increase learning rates
for epoch in range(100):
    if epoch % 20 == 0:
        cfg.fast_trace_lr *= 1.2  # 20% increase
        cfg.sigma *= 1.1           # 10% increase
```

**When:** Learning phase, optimization.

#### 3. Task-Specific Adaptation

```python
# For fast-changing tasks
if task_type == "dynamic":
    cfg.fast_trace_lr = 0.05
    cfg.fast_trace_decay = 0.9

# For stable tasks
elif task_type == "static":
    cfg.fast_trace_lr = 0.01
    cfg.fast_trace_decay = 0.95

# v5.0: High-dimensional optimization
if state_dim > 64:
    cfg.use_diagonal_covariance = True  # 12x speedup
```

## 10. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - How It Works in Reality

### 📈 Metrics

#### 1. Learning Curve

```python
# Convergence speed
convergence_rate = (final_performance - initial_performance) / num_episodes

# Convergence point
convergence_point = np.argmax(performance > target_performance * 0.95)
```

**Analogy:** How fast does system reach 95% performance.

#### 2. Memory Efficiency

```python
# Pattern separation
pattern_separation = measure_pattern_separation()

# Pattern completion
pattern_completion = measure_pattern_completion()
```

**Analogy:** How well can system distinguish and reconstruct new and old patterns.

#### 3. Catastrophic Forgetting

```python
# Previous task performance after new learning
forgetting_rate = (old_task_performance_after_new - old_task_performance_before_new)
```

**Analogy:** How much do we forget previous tasks when learning new ones.

### 🔍 Diagnostics

#### Trace Norm Monitoring

```python
# Fast trace norm
fast_trace_norm = np.linalg.norm(fast_trace)

# Evaluation
if fast_trace_norm < 0.5:
    print("⚠️ Learning too slow")
elif fast_trace_norm > 5.0:
    print("⚠️ Instability")
else:
    print("✅ Healthy learning")
```

#### Uncertainty Analysis

```python
# Epistemic vs Aleatoric uncertainty
epistemic = ensemble_disagreement()  # knowledge lack
aleatoric = measurement_variance()    # data noise

# Exploration motivation
exploration_bonus = beta * epistemic
```

**Analogy:** 
- Epistemic: "I don't know what this is" (more data helps)
- Aleatoric: "Data is noisy" (more data doesn't help)

## 11. DYNAMIC TOP-DOWN MODULATION (ORTHOS v5.0)

### 🎯 Overview

Dynamic Modulation is the mechanism by which high-level "conceptual" states influence low-level "perceptual" processing. This reflects the biological reality where your mood or environment changes your sensory sensitivity.

### 📐 Conceptual Regime Detection

ORTHOS monitors its internal representation to detect three primary regimes:

1.  **Stable**: Prediction errors are low, uncertainty is falling.
    - *Action*: Trust sensors more ($R \downarrow$), rely on established patterns.
2.  **Transition**: Prediction errors rising, but structure still exists.
    - *Action*: Increase exploratory noise, prepare for regime shift.
3.  **Storm (Chaos)**: Sudden spikes in innovation, high uncertainty.
    - *Action*: Trust sensors less ($R \uparrow$), increase process flexibility ($Q \uparrow$), wait for consolidation.

**The Modulation Formula:**
$$ R_{dynamic} = R_{base} \cdot m_{concept} $$
Where $m_{concept}$ is the modulation factor (e.g., 2.0 for "Storm", 0.5 for "Stable").

### 🧬 Biological Parallel

In a "Storm" state (e.g., entering a dark, foggy room), your brain trusts raw visual data less and relies more on internal spatial models and careful movement. As the environment becomes "Stable," you trust your eyes more.

> **⚠️ A Note on Realism:** Unlike hyperbolic financial "get-rich-quick" models, ORTHOS benchmarks focus on physical systems and signal processing. While directional accuracy in chaotic markets like the S&P 500 is notoriously capped at ~51-54% (even for legendary firms like Renaissance Technologies), ORTHOS provides substantial leads in **bounded physical systems** like robotics, where its probabilistic filtering and SAS architecture can truly shine. Avoid benchmarks that "see the future" via Look-Ahead Bias!

## 14. SUMMARY - Key Takeaways

### ✅ Quick Start

1. **Start with low learning rates** (0.01-0.001)
2. **Use homeostatic regulation**
3. **Monitor trace norms**
4. **Only increase complexity when stable**
5. **v5.0**: Enable `use_joseph_form=True` for production
6. **v5.0**: Use `auto_projection=True` for multi-level hierarchies

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Too high learning rate
```python
# Bad
cfg.fast_trace_lr = 0.5  # Instability!

# Good
cfg.fast_trace_lr = 0.01  # Stable
```

**Mistake 2:** No homeostatic regulation
```python
# Bad
# No normalization → weights grow indefinitely

# Good
if trace_norm > target:
    trace *= target / trace_norm  # Normalize
```

**Mistake 3:** Too many levels at once
```python
# Bad
# 8 levels too complex for starting

# Good
# 2-3 levels sufficient for testing
```

**Mistake 4:** Not using v5.0 optimizations
```python
# Bad
kf = KalmanFilter(state_dim=128)  # Slow, memory intensive

# Good
kf = KalmanFilter(state_dim=128, use_diagonal_covariance=True)  # 12x faster
```

**Mistake 5:** Manual projection errors or using outdated attribute names
```python
# Bad (v4.x thinking)
try:
    p = result.aggregated_prediction  # ❌ AttributeError in v5.0
except AttributeError:
    p = result.prediction             # ✅ Correct v5.0 way

# Bad (Manual dimension handling)
if l1.dim != l2.dim:
    # manual upsampling/downsampling... (prone to errors)
    pass

# Good (v5.0)
manager = ConsensusHierarchyManager(auto_projection=True)  # ✅ Handled automatically
```

**Mistake 6:** Incorrect Adaptive Noise (The "Original ORTHOS Bug")
```python
# Bad (Legacy/Pre-v5.0)
def _adapt_noise(self, y, S):
    if innov > threshold:
        self.Q *= 1.1  # ❌ ERROR: Modifying Process Noise instead of Observation Noise
        
# Good (v5.0)
def _adapt_noise(self, y, S):
    if innov > threshold:
        self.R *= 1.1  # ✅ Correctly modifies Observation Noise
```

## CONCLUSION

ORTHOS is a complex but well-structured system that combines different mathematical methods:

1. **Hebbian learning** - fundamental correlation-based learning
2. **Plasticity control** - adaptive learning parameters
3. **Hierarchical processing** - multi-scale abstraction
4. **Consensus engine** - robust aggregation (v5.0: auto-projection, top-down feedback)
5. **Filters** - probabilistic state estimation (v5.0: diagonal covariance, Joseph form)
6. **Meta-learning** - learning optimization
7. **Sparse Attention** - energy-efficient active inference (v5.0: SAS framework)

The system's strength lies in its modular architecture and biological inspiration. Each layer solves a specific problem, and together they form an efficient, adaptive system.

**The ORTHOS Advantage:** Through hierarchical consensus, dual-timescale memory, and probabilistic filtering, ORTHOS maintains performance where traditional systems fail—under noise, sensor failures, and unexpected conditions.

**v5.0 Enhancements:** 
- **10-100x Speedup**: Diagonal Kalman Filter O(N) optimization for high-dim systems.
- **SAS Architecture**: Sparse Attention and Structural Plasticity for 70% memory reduction.
- **Uncertainty-Weighted Consensus**: Mathematically optimal Bayesian fusion.
- **Bayesian Dual Fusion**: Faster, more elegant bidirectional information flow.
- **Numerical Stability**: Joseph Form covariance updates and adaptive noise floors.
- **Infrastructure**: Auto-projection for mismatched dimensions and comprehensive v5.0 testing.

**Key:** Start simple, gradually increase complexity, and continuously monitor performance!

## 14. ORTHOS CAYLEY LAYER - Implicit Orthogonality (v5.1)

### 🎯 Overview

The **Orthos Cayley Layer** is a specialized weight layer that guarantees orthogonality ($W W^T = I$) without the need for expensive explicit projection or Gram-Schmidt normalization. It uses **Implicit Parameterization** via the Cayley Transform, making it ideal for maintaining stable hidden dynamics and preventing gradient explosion/vanishing.

### 📐 1. Skew-Symmetric Parameterization

Instead of learning the weight matrix $W$ directly, we learn a **Skew-Symmetric** matrix $S$. A matrix is skew-symmetric if:
$$ S^T = -S $$

In ORTHOS, we enforce this by taking an unconstrained parameter matrix $A$ and computing:
$$ S = A - A^T $$

**Significance:** This reduction in degrees of freedom (from $N^2$ to $N(N-1)/2$) ensures the parameters always stay on a manifold that can be transformed into the Orthogonal Group.

### 📐 2. The Cayley Transform

The bridge between skew-symmetric matrices and orthogonal matrices is the **Cayley Transform**:
$$ W = (I - S)(I + S)^{-1} $$

**Key Properties:**
- If $S$ is skew-symmetric, then $W$ is **Orthogonal** ($W^T W = I$).
- **Volume Preservation**: The transform produces a matrix where $\det(W) = 1$, meaning it belongs to the **Special Orthogonal Group SO(n)**. It preserves the L2 norm of the input and the volume of the state space, ensuring that signal energy is neither amplified nor destroyed during processing.

### 📐 3. Rectified Orthogonality (Non-Square Matrices)

While the Cayley transform is naturally defined for square matrices, ORTHOS v5.1 supports **Rectified Orthogonality** for rectangular layers ($M \times N$).

**The Process:**
1.  Define a square skew-symmetric kernel of size $K = \max(M, N)$.
2.  Compute the square orthogonal matrix $W_{square}$ ($K \times K$).
3.  **Truncate/Rectify**: Extract the sub-matrix of size $M \times N$.

**Result:** This produces a semi-orthogonal matrix where the rows (or columns) are orthonormal, maintaining the "near-isometric" properties required for stability even in dimension-changing layers.

### 🧬 Implementation Logic

```python
# 1. Enforce Skew-Symmetry
S = params - params.T

# 2. Cayley Transform (Implicit Orthogonality)
I = np.eye(max_dim)
W_square = np.linalg.solve(I + S, I - S)

# 3. Rectify for Non-Square (M x N)
weight = W_square[:M, :N]
```

**Practical Advantage:** This layer is essential for the **Probabilistic Spine** in Level 3, where keeping the Kalman Filter's state transition matrix stable is critical for long-term convergence. It prevents the covariance from shrinking to zero or exploding.
